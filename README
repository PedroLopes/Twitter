This is a small demo project, it is a random sentence generator that uses:
- python script to generate gramma drover sentences
- lm-sensors to read the temperature of a AMD dual core (4 values)
- twidge to send the sentences to your twitter account

At the moment it is not generic, If you want to run it, you may have to do some mods in the shell scripts (the paths and the lm-sensors read).

The pseudo-random generator is based on Peter Norvig's Python vs. Lisp article:
- http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html

The phrases are then altered with the reads of the lm-sensors. You can check the twitter feed here: http://twitter.com/PirateBroadcast
